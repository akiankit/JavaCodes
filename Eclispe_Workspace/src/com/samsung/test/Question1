You are given a positive integer. You repeatedly multiply it to make a sequene. For example, given a integers 2, the sequence is 2, 2*2, 2*2*2, 2*2*2*2, 2*2*2*2*2, ... Among them, the first number greater than 1000 is 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2=1024.

  
Given a positive integers, write a program that finds the first number exceeding 1000 when you repeatedly multiply it.
